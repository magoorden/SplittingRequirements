Initial (uncontrolled system):         A_x2distributing.On and S_gripper.Off and (S_product4.Off and (S_transfer_atdrop.Off and S_transfer_athalfway.On)) and (S_transfer_atpickup.Off and S_xpos_at1.Off and (S_xpos_at2.Off and (S_xpos_at3.Off and S_xpos_atdrop.On)))
Initial (controlled system):           A_x2distributing.On and S_gripper.Off and (S_product4.Off and (S_transfer_atdrop.Off and S_transfer_athalfway.On)) and (S_transfer_atpickup.Off and S_xpos_at1.Off and (S_xpos_at2.Off and (S_xpos_at3.Off and S_xpos_atdrop.On)))
Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
Initial (added by supervisor):         true

Simplification of controlled system under the assumption of the plants, requirement automata, state/event exclusion requirement invariants, state requirement invariants, and controlled behavior:
  Event A_x2distributing_c_off: guard: <bdd 18n 13p> -> true [assume <bdd 18n 13p>].
  Event A_x2distributing_c_on: guard: <bdd 11n 12p> -> true [assume <bdd 11n 12p>].
